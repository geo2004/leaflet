With the help of modern technology, the idea of a show combining breath-taking views of the solar system and beyond, played out to 42 minutes of The Dark Side Of The Moon in surround sound, has been embraced by the band. NSC Creative have led the visual production efforts, working closely with Pink Floyd’s long time creative collaborator Aubrey Powell from Hipgnosis.\n\nEach song has a different theme; some futuristically looking forward and some a retro acknowledgment to Pink Floyd’s visual history, all relating to a time and space experience, embracing up to the minute technology that only a Planetarium can offer.

Pronounced “tank” with a whiff of the “g” - an onomatopoeic reference to the lashing way the band imagined their guitars sounding that has since grown into a sigil for living in love - the record is the band’s most ambitious and striking work yet. Where IDLES were once set on taking the world’s piss, squaring off with strong jaws against the perennially entitled, and exercising personal trauma in real time, they have arrived in this new act to offer the fruits of such perseverance: love, joy, and indeed gratitude for the mere opportunity of existence.\n\nA radical sense of defiant empowerment radiates from TANGK, co-produced by Nigel Godrich, IDLES guitarist Mark Bowen, and Kenny Beats. Despite his reputation as an incendiary post-punk sparkplug, frontman Joe Talbot sings almost all the feelings inside these 10 songs with hard-earned soul, offering each lusty vow or solidarity plea as a bona fide pop song—that is, a thing for everyone to pass around and share, communal anthems intended for overcoming our grievance. Lead single “Dancer” stands as the throbbing and scuzzy highlight at the album’s center - rattling bass and ricocheting guitar giving Talbot space to talk about sweat and sex on the dancefloor. (You will spy LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy and Nancy Whang here, too, singing.) It is lascivious and playful and positive, the ecstatic sound of at least a temporary fix. In the improvised hook, Talbot offers IDLES’ essential new mantra: “I give myself to you/As long as you move on the floor.”\n\nHe is singing about the rapture of a new relationship, but he is also singing about the special dynamic between IDLES and their fans, or IDLES and the world at large. This is a band’s vow to keep lifting and fighting for themselves and their listeners, to keep offering the grim persistence of joy and hope and love and wonder as long as that’s what anyone needs to survive. It is a love song the same way that TANGK is a love album—open to anyone who requires something to shout out loud in order to fend off any encroaching sense of the void, now or forever.", "event_template": "Brisbane City Council", "event_type": "Featured,Music", "venue": "Riverstage, Brisbane City", "venueaddress": "Riverstage, Gardens Point Road, Brisbane City", "lat": -27.47497223, "long_": 153.0253778, "venuetype": "General Council venue", "primaryeventtype": "Music", "cost": "Priced ticketed event", "eventimage": "https://www.trumba.com/i/DgBbax7ELW25KyqaVkZgkX1Z.jpg", "age": "Suitable for all ages", "bookings": "Tickets can be purchased via <a href=\"https://www.ticketmaster.com.au/idles-brisbane-18-01-2025/event/1300606EC3BE3899\" target=\"_blank\">Ticketmaster</a>.", "bookingsrequired": "Yes", "parentevent": null, "agerange": null, "libraryeventtypes": null, "maximumparticipantcapacity": null, "activitytype": null, "requirements": null, "meetingpoint": null, "status": null, "waterwayaccessfacilities": null, "waterwayaccessinformation": null, "locationifvenueunavailable": null, "communityhall": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 153.025377800000115, -27.474972229999935 ] } },

Now, Houston, Texas psych-funk trio Khruangbin return to Australia next summer with shows in Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney in February/March 2025 as part of their global A LA SALA tour.\n\nHaving recently wowed fans at European festivals such as Rock Werchter and Roskilde, bassist Laura Lee Ochoa, drummer Donald ‘DJ’ Johnson, Jr., and guitarist Mark ‘Marko’ Speer will return to Australia to celebrate their first album in four years: A LA SALA (“To the room” in Spanish). If 2020’s Mordechai was a party record that enhanced the band’s musical reputation, A LA SALA is the measured morning after. A gorgeously airy album made with minimal overdubs, A LA SALA scales Khruangbin down to scale up, a creative strategy with the future in mind.\n\nKhruangbin launched the A LA SALA tour in April at Coachella, with sold out shows across US/Canada in May/June. With festival sets at Nos Alive (Lisbon), Latitude (Suffolk), Bilbao BBK (Spain) and Bonnaroo (US) on the itinerary, and European/UK dates in November, Khruangbin return to Australia in early 2025 for what promises to be some of the hottest shows this summer.\n\nJoining Khruangbin as special guest at all shows and making their debut trip to Australia is acclaimed two-piece Hermanos Gutiérrez, the instrumental guitar duo of Swiss/Ecuadorian brothers Alejandro and Estevan Gutiérrez. The pair’s new album, Sonido Cósmico,  was released in June and produced by Dan Auerbach (The Black Keys). Brimming with Latin mystique and otherworldly guitar interplay that “shimmers with hallucinogenic energy” (Rolling Stone), the album is an odyssey through lush musical soundscapes, as heard on lead single ‘Barrio Hustle’.", "event_template": "Brisbane City Council", "event_type": "Featured,Music", "venue": "Riverstage, Brisbane City", "venueaddress": "Riverstage, Gardens Point Road, Brisbane City", "lat": -27.47497223, "long_": 153.0253778, "venuetype": "General Council venue", "primaryeventtype": "Music", "cost": "Priced ticketed event", "eventimage": "https://www.trumba.com/i/DgDY4QBPVAdCWJc9xC3y85Ur.jpg", "age": "Suitable for all ages", "bookings": "Tickets can be purchased <a href=\"https://www.ticketmaster.com.au/khruangbin-brisbane-02-03-2025/event/130060FDA8F157C2\" target=\"_blank\">Ticketmaster</a>.", "bookingsrequired": "Yes", "parentevent": null, "agerange": null, "libraryeventtypes": null, "maximumparticipantcapacity": null, "activitytype": null, "requirements": null, "meetingpoint": null, "status": null, "waterwayaccessfacilities": null, "waterwayaccessinformation": null, "locationifvenueunavailable": null, "communityhall": null }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 153.025377800000115, -27.474972229999935 ] } },

In her initial sketches of songs for Buzz, NIKI took cues from other lane-paving women with confessional, honest lyricism soundtracked by guitars. “Joni Mitchell is my songwriting north star,” she says — and uncompromising feminist luminaries like Stevie Nicks, Carly Simon and Liz Phair. To match the wandering spirit of Buzz, NIKI cultivated her own elastic approach to guitar.\n\nFor NIKI, things have been happening progressively since she was a high schooler in Jakarta, Indonesia. As a student at an international academy, she cut her teeth scribbling lovesick poems in English class and performed acoustic guitar covers of American pop songs on YouTube. With a six-string in hand, and her family and classmates cheering her on from the audience, Nicole Zefanya then staked her claim to global stardom as NIKI.\n\nAnd claim it she has - with over three billion streams worldwide, sold out shows on multiple continents, massive sets at festivals across the globe, front row seats at Paris Fashion Week, four songs on a Marvel film’s soundtrack, and some of the most phenomenal, confessional songs being released in 2024, NIKI has already established a veteran’s resume before the age of 25.
